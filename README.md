# Find me a house

Marimo notebooks I'm using to find a house in Perth, Australia. So far, it's just financial analysis that most people would do in Excel.

## Notebook descriptions

- `borrowing_power.py`
    - Borrowing power calculator based on simple inputs.
- `cashflows.py`
    - Comparing cashflows between living in PPOR and rentvesting.
- `property_analyser/`
    - Find useful information on a property such as:
        - Proximity to amenities.
        - Proximity to social housing.
        - Flood zones.
        - Crime rates.
